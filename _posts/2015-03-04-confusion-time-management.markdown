So after days of planning, the most basic things which haunts me is time and project management. The undue pressure is taking on me and it has become so difficult to manage and prioritize my tasks.

I hope that I find a solution to this problem as soon as possible. I wil try to pen down my experiences daily to analyze the faults.

TODO:
* Look for a project management solution
* Create an active task list.
* Log all the experiences and daily activities.
