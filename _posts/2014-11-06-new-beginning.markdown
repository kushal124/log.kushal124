So I have been given a new beginning and new way to make things better.
This is finally the time I have to start pushing myself beyond the limits.
The do or die situation is here.


### Things to do:
* Read about Gaussian Processes.
* Start writing thesis
* Run some more experiments
* Improve those results
* Read some more theory
* Explore Germany :)
